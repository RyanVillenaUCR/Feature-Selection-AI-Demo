# Feature-Selection-AI-Demo

A demo of feature selection for my AI class.

## Usage

I recommend you use `./compile_and_run.sh` to demo this program. You might need to run `chmod +x compile_and_run.sh` first to grant executable permissions to the shell script.

In case it prints out a lot of output, you can use `./compile_and_run.sh >> log.txt` to write to a text file instead.
